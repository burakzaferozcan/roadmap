2. Which topics am I strong in, and which ones do I need to work on more?
3. Can I apply what I've learned in a real project?
4. How can I improve my code quality and productivity?

It is recommended to dedicate at least 2-3 hours each week to doing code practice, developing small projects, and reinforcing what you've learned.
